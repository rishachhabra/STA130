    "1. **DEMO_education** (Q74 series, indicating highest educational attainment)  \n",
    "   - **Description**: This variable represents the highest level of education completed by individuals, categorized into levels such as high school, college, bachelor’s degree, graduate degree, etc. It is a categorical variable, which can be effectively visualized using a bar chart. This chart will show the number or percentage of individuals within each educational category, offering insight into the educational structure of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DEMO_occupation** (Q136, providing information on employment type or field)  \n",
    "   - **Description**: This variable refers to the participants’ employment type or field, which may correlate with socio-economic status. It is either ordinal (if on a scale) or categorical and can be visualized using a bar chart. This visualization is effective for showing the distribution of responses across different occupation types, providing insight into the occupational structure within the sample population.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **WELLNESS_life_satisfaction** (Q16)\n",
    "   - **Description**: This variable measures an individual's perceived satisfaction with life, on a scale of 1-10. The type is categorical. A box plot is suitable for visualizing this variable, as it enables easy comparison of life satisfaction scores across different education levels or occupation types, providing a clear picture of the median, quartiles, and potential outliers in each group.\n",

    "To explore how education and occupation affect self-reported life satisfaction, we’ll focus on basic statistical techniques and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Descriptive Statistics**:  \n",
    "   - Calculate the mean, median, range, and standard deviation for life satisfaction within each education and occupation group to summarize typical levels and variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Visualization**:\n",
    "   - **Box Plots**: Display the median, spread, and potential outliers across education levels and occupation types.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comparing Group Means**:  \n",
    "   - Visually compare the average life satisfaction scores across groups to identify patterns or differences.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: There is no difference in self-reported life satisfaction across different education levels and occupation types.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: There is a difference in self-reported life satisfaction across different education levels and occupation types.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Interpretation**:  \n",
    "   - If higher education levels or specific occupations show higher average life satisfaction, it may indicate an association with well-being. Similar means across groups suggest limited impact from education or occupation on life satisfaction, using visual comparisons to interpret patterns without advanced tests.\n",
