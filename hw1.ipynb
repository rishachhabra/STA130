    "Indeed, STA130 Homework essentially boils down to completing various understanding confirmation exercises oriented around coding and writing tasks.\n",
    "However, rather than reading a textbook, STA130 Homework is based on ChatBots so students can interactively follow up to clarify questions or confusion that they may still have regarding learning objective assignments.\n",

    "It will likely become increasingly tempting to rely on ChatBots to \"do the work for you\". But when you find yourself frustrated with a ChatBots inability to give you the results you're looking for, this is a \"hint\" that you've become overreliant on the ChatBots. Your objective should not be to have ChatBots \"do the work for you\", but to use ChatBots to help you build your understanding so you can efficiently leverage ChatBots (and other resources) to help you work more efficiently.<br><br>\n",

    "\n",
    "> This problem will guide you through exploring how to use a ChatBot to troubleshoot code using the \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv\" data set \n",
    "> \n",
    "> To initialially constrain the scope of the reponses from your ChatBot, start a new ChatBot session with the following slight variation on the initial prompting approach from \"2\" above\n",
    "> - \"I am going to do some initial simple summary analyses on the titanic data set I've downloaded (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv) which has some missing values, and I'd like to get your help understanding the code I'm using and the analysis it's performing\"\n",
    "        \n",
    "1. Use your ChatBot session to understand what `df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()` does and then demonstrate and explain this using a different example from the \"titanic\" data set other than what the ChatBot automatically provide for you\n",
    "    \n",
    "> If needed, you can help guide the ChatBot by showing it the code you've used to download the data **AND provide it with the names of the columns** using either a summary of the data with `df.describe()` or just `df.columns` as demonstrated [here](../CHATLOG/COP/00017_copilot_groupby.md)\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Assuming you've not yet removed missing values in the manner of question \"7\" above, `df.describe()` would have different values in the `count` value for different data columns depending on the missingness present in the original data.  Why do these capture something fundamentally different from the values in the `count` that result from doing something like `df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()`?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Questions \"4\" and \"6\" above address how missing values are handled by `df.describe()` (which is reflected in the `count` output of this method); but, `count` in conjunction with `group_by` has another primary function that's more important than addressing missing values (although missing data could still play a role here).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Intentionally introduce the following errors into your code and report your opinion as to whether it's easier to (a) work in a ChatBot session to fix the errors, or (b) use google to search for and fix errors: first share the errors you get in the ChatBot session and see if you can work with ChatBot to troubleshoot and fix the coding errors, and then see if you think a google search for the error provides the necessary toubleshooting help more quickly than ChatGPT<br><br>\n",

    "Summary: Here’s a summary of our recent sessions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dataset Exploration with pandas:**\n",
    "   - You worked with a dataset on villagers, loaded from a URL into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "   - We discussed various ways to analyze this dataset, such as using `df.describe()` for summary statistics, `df.info()` to get information on data types and non-null counts, and `df['column'].value_counts()` for analyzing non-numeric categorical data like the `species` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Concepts Discussed:**\n",
    "   - We explored the difference between **attributes** (e.g., `df.shape`) and **methods** (e.g., `df.describe()`), emphasizing how attributes hold information and methods perform actions on the DataFrame.\n",
    "   - We talked about discrepancies between the dataset size (using `df.shape`) and what is reported by `df.describe()`, particularly when dealing with non-numeric columns or missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Providing Summaries and Missing Values:**\n",
    "   - We discussed how to check for missing values in columns using `df.isna().sum()` and explored ways to provide simple summaries of the dataset, including using `df.describe(include='all')` to capture both numeric and non-numeric columns.\n",
    "   - You were introduced to using `df['column'].value_counts()` to understand the distribution of categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Code Examples:**\n",
    "   - Several code examples were provided for summarizing your dataset:\n",
    "     - `df.describe()` for summary statistics.\n",
    "     - `df.info()` for non-null counts and data types.\n",
    "     - `df['column'].value_counts()` for categorical data frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. you asked for clarification on the difference between an attribute and a method in Python. I explained that an attribute, like df.shape, gives you stored information directly, while a method, like df.describe(), performs a computation or action and typically requires parentheses. I then provided a paraphrased summary of this difference for better understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. we explored various coding errors in Python, focusing on how ChatGPT and Google can help troubleshoot them. Here's a summary of the key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Errors and Fixes:***\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing import: Forgetting to import a library like pandas causes a NameError. ChatGPT quickly suggests adding the import.\n",
